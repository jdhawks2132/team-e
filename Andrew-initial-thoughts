# Initial thoughts for data structure planning

## Project Structure
Each level consists of (at minimum): [Title, Description]

- Project, a collection of phases
  - Phase(s), belong to a project, can be split into tasks
    - Task(s), belong to a phase

## Attributes 
Should be applicable to any Project, Phase, or Task:

- Priority [Urgent, High, Moderate, Low, None]
- Dependencies [Waiting On, Blocking, Linked To]
- Status [Complete, In-progress, Stuck, Not Started]
- Deadline (Calendar date, due date)
- Time (String estimation of how much time task/phase will take to complete)
- Budget (Number, the user estimation)
- Cost (Number, the actual cost during project)

## User structure with respect to Project:
(Do we want to grant project owners special rights? Probably yes)
- ADMIN
  - Can create and own a project
  - Can add/invite users to the project
  - Can delete a project

- USER (including admin)
  - Can create and modify phases & respective attributes
  - Can create and modify tasks & respective attributes
  - Can change personal information: [Name, Email, Password, Icon]
